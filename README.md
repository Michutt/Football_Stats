# Football_Stats
Creating a football graph about specific football player from ISport API

You can create your own url for free here: https://www.isportsapi.com,
then just copy it on file "stats.py" in variable "key". Also you should put your player
(works only for Serie A and La liga) in "playerName". 
Run main.py
